# AktivityTracker

This is a tool for inspecting the usage from your pc, to show you what application you use over the day.
The data is saved to your local device and so you have the full control of your data

## What is the goal?
The goal is to make a program that don't catch your data and push it on a cloud system. We want to save
the data locally on your device. If you don't want to chare the file, you don't have to.

Because you have full control of your data you can import it to datasheet like excel sheet and make some
sweet ass diagrams. To control your self, with what tool you spent the most time with. And maybe to
make a time improvement in your daily plan
